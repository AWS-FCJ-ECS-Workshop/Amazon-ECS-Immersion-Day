CloudWatch Container Insights collects metrics and logs from your containerized applications and microservices. It employs a containerized CloudWatch agent to discover and gather performance data from all running containers in a cluster. This data is then utilized to generate aggregated metrics at the cluster, service, and task levels, including resource utilization metrics for CPU, memory, disk, and network.

When you need regular statistics on aggregated data over time, it's preferable to use metrics rather than logs. Metrics are ideal for creating alarms or dashboard graphs.

### Explore Container Insights metrics

To explore metrics, first open the CloudWatch Container Insights console:

In the CloudWatch console, select **Service: ECS** from the Service dropdown and **Performance Monitoring** from the second dropdown at the top. Then, choose the **retail-store-ecs-cluster**. Finally, change ECS Cluster to **ECS Services**.

You can observe various metrics such as **CPU Utilization**, **Memory Utilization**, **Network RX/TX**, and **Ephemeral Storage Utilization**. These key metrics and automated dashboards are automatically generated by CloudWatch Container Insights based on the **retail-store-ecs-cluster**. Since these metrics are also available in CloudWatch Metrics, they can be used for creating custom dashboards as well.
