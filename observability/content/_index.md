# Observability with Amazon ECS

Observability is the capability to continuously generate and discover actionable insights based on signals from the system under observation. In other words, observability allows users to understand a system's state from its external output and take appropriate action. The three pillars of observability are metrics, logs, and traces:

#### Metrics

- Metrics represent numeric data measured over time intervals. They leverage mathematical modeling and prediction to understand the behavior of a system in both the present and future.
- They are useful for identifying trends and enabling mathematical modeling and prediction.

#### Logs

- Logs consist of immutable, timestamped records capturing discrete events as they occur over time. They are valuable for detecting emergent and unpredictable behavior.
- They are particularly useful for uncovering emergent and unpredictable behavior patterns.

#### Traces

- Traces depict a sequence of interconnected distributed events that outline the end-to-end journey of a request through a distributed system. They offer insights, such as latency, into the path taken by a request and its structure.
- They provide visibility into both the path traversed by a request as well as the structure of a request.

In summary, we can break observability down into three main components: CloudWatch Metrics, CloudWatch Logs, and AWS X-Ray. Together, these form a comprehensive observability solution on AWS, covering metric monitoring, log management, and distributed tracing, respectively. These pillars work in tandem to provide users with deep insights into the behavior, performance, and reliability of their AWS environments and applications.
