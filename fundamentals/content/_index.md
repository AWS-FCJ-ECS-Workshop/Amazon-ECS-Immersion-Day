Welcome to the workshop series on Amazon Elastic Container Service!

This workshop series includes **7 practical exercises** to help you comprehensively understand Amazon Elastic Container Services.

1. [Fundamentals](#) - Build foundational knowledge about Network, deploy sample applications and initialize ECS Services
2. [Auto Scaling](../../../auto-scaling/) - Automatically adjust application scale based on actual demands
3. [Networking](../../../networking/) - Design and implement optimal network models
4. [Observability](../../../observability/) - Build comprehensive monitoring and observation systems
5. [Security](../../../security/) - Deploy security solutions and access control
6. [Automation](../../../automation/) - Automate application deployment processes

#### What is Amazon Elastic Container Service?

**Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)** is AWS's fully managed container orchestration service. This service allows you to deploy, manage, and scale container applications efficiently. ECS integrates tightly with the AWS ecosystem, providing a simple solution for operating container workloads in cloud and on-premises environments, with enhanced security features through Amazon ECS Anywhere.

**AWS Fargate** is a serverless computing technology with a pay-as-you-go model. Fargate allows you to focus on application development without managing infrastructure. By delegating server management, resource allocation, and scaling tasks to AWS, you not only optimize operations but also accelerate product development in the cloud while optimizing overall costs.

#### What will you learn?
This workshop is designed in modules to help you explore important topics about Amazon ECS:

1. Master the fundamentals of **Amazon ECS and Fargate**, including clusters, tasks, and services
2. Deploy **auto scaling** systems to automatically adjust to load
3. Build **comprehensive monitoring** systems through logs, metrics, and traces
4. Deep dive into AWS Fargate networking and **advanced network architecture**
5. Deploy **comprehensive security** solutions, including credential and secrets management
6. Build **automated deployment** processes on Amazon ECS using CI/CD pipelines

#### Target Audience

This **200+** level workshop is designed for:
- Software Development Engineers
- Platform Engineers
- IT Professionals

Suitable for those who want hands-on experience with Amazon ECS, from basic components to advanced features in deploying and managing container workloads.
