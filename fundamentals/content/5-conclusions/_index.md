In this first Fundamentals section of the Amazon ECS workshop series, we have completed the following important contents:

1. Set up the foundation environment
2. Deploy and operate Amazon ECS Cluster
3. Configure and manage ECS Services

This is the core foundation, creating a solid premise for implementing the advanced labs that follow in the workshop series.

### Next Steps

To continue your journey exploring Amazon ECS, we invite you to discover the following workshop sections:

1. [Auto Scaling](/auto-scaling/) - Automatically adjust application scale
2. [Networking](../../../networking/) - Design and implement network models
3. [Observability](../../../observability/) - System monitoring and observation
4. [Security](../../../security/) - Security and access control
5. [Automation](../../../automation/) - Automate deployment processes

Each workshop section will help you build in-depth knowledge about a specific aspect of Amazon ECS, enabling you to effectively apply it to real projects.
