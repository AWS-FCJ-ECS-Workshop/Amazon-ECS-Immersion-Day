In this first Fundamentals section of the Amazon ECS workshop series, we have completed the following important contents:

1. Set up the foundation environment
2. Deploy and operate Amazon ECS Cluster
3. Configure and manage ECS Services

This is the core foundation, creating a solid premise for implementing the advanced labs that follow in the workshop series.
