# AWS ECS Immersion Day Workshop

This project contains multiple standalone Hugo sites, each representing a specific topic in the AWS ECS Immersion Day workshop.

## Sections

The workshop is divided into the following sections:

- `auto-scaling` – Explore ECS service scaling options.
- `automation` – Automate ECS deployments and operations.
- `fundamentals` – Core concepts of ECS and container orchestration.
- `networking` – Set up secure and scalable networking for ECS.
- `observability` – Monitor and trace ECS workloads.
- `security` – Secure your ECS applications and infrastructure.
- `storage` – Integrate persistent storage with ECS tasks.

Each folder is a self-contained Hugo site and can be built independently via GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows`.

## Build & Deploy

Each section is automatically built and deployed using GitHub Actions when changes are pushed.
