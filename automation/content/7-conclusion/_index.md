In this Automation module, we successfully implemented several key components that enable the automated deployment of containerized applications to Amazon ECS using AWS CodePipeline, including:

1. **Integration of AWS CodePipeline with ECS:** We automated the entire workflow from code changes to deployment, ensuring faster and more reliable software releases.

2. **Four Main Pipeline Stages:**

   1. Source Stage: Pulls the latest code from a source repository like GitHub or AWS CodeCommit.

   2. Build Stage: Compiles the code, builds a Docker image using AWS CodeBuild, and optionally runs tests.

   3. Registry Push: Pushes the built image to Amazon ECR, with optional security scanning.

   4. Deploy Stage: Updates the ECS service using the new Docker image by modifying the task definition and launching updated tasks.

3. **Rolling Deployment Strategy:**

   - We implemented a rolling update strategy to gradually replace old versions with new ones, minimizing downtime and maintaining service availability.

   - Controlled through key parameters such as minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent to manage speed and stability.

4. **Optional Testing & Approval Steps:**

   - Added integration or smoke tests post-deployment.

   - Included manual approval stages for enhanced control before proceeding with deployment.

5. **Monitoring & Rollback:**

   - Enabled monitoring with CloudWatch Logs, ECS Service Events, and CloudWatch Alarms.

   - Configured automatic rollback to the last stable version if deployment fails.
